# OpenCV:Corner Detection Algorithms in Python

## my goal: learn python (numpy, pandas, OpenCV) with a focus on robotic applications

This project implements classic corner detection algorithms such as:

- Moravec Corner Detector
- Harris Corner Detector (coming soon)

## Usage

Run the notebook `cornerdetectors.ipynb` to see the detectors in action.
