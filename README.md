# OpenCV:Corner Detection Algorithms in Python

## my goal: learn python (numpy, pandas, OpenCV) with a focus on robotic applications

This project implements classic corner detection algorithms such as:

[- Moravec Corner Detector
](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/features2d/trackingmotion/harris_detector/harris_detector.html)- Harris Corner Detector (coming soon)

## Usage

Run the notebook `corner_detector.ipynb` to see the detectors in action.
