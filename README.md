# OpenCV:Corner Detection Algorithms in Python

## my goal: learn python (numpy, pandas, OpenCV) with a focus on robotic applications

This project implements classic corner detection algorithms such as:

- [Moravec Corner Detector](https://mahendrathapa.medium.com/moravec-corner-detector-5191f1c04b30)
- [Harris Corner Detector](https://docs.opencv.org/2.4/doc/tutorials/features2d/trackingmotion/harris_detector/harris_detector.html)
  
- [FAST: Features from Accelerated Segment Test](https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/df/d0c/tutorial_py_fast.html)
- SIFT
- SURF: Speeded Up Robust Features
- MSER: Maximally Stable Extremal Regions
- BRIEF: Binary Robust Independent Elementary Features
- ORB:Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF


- Nearest Neighbors
- RANSAC 
  
## How to use this project?

Open the notebook `corner_detector.ipynb` to see the detectors in action.
